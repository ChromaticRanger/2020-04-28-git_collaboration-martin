# Git Collaboration Workshop 
Oreilly git collaboration workshop

- `git clone` <URL>: downloads the repo from the web to your computer
    - make sure you do not nest this command inside another repo
    - just do this once per repo

- `git branch <branch_name>`: create a new branch
- `git switch <branch_name>`: move to a branch
    - `git checkout -b <branch_name>`:  

- `git stash`: temporarily saves your work to a virtual commit
